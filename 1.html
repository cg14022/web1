  <h2>How to 80/20 your life 이 뭐길래</h2>

  <p>You can get what you want with less.
  It's all about <strong>identifying <u>where to make a split</u>.</strong></p>

  <p>And of course, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">
    80/20 principle</a> can still be applied to productivity at work.

  Obviously, the 80/20 rule is not necessarily a rigid dictum to live by.
  But think of it as a tool, a lens to veiw aspects of your life through.
  Sit down and think about it, maybe even write it out.
  You'll likely be surprised with the realizations you come to.
